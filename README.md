## Hi 👋 I'm Felippe!

I'm a passionate backend developer and I'm always looking to learn and improve my skills through reading, self-knowledge and technical courses.

In my career, I've realized that my greatest passion is leading and coordinating technology teams with challenging goals. There is nothing better than helping people to grow professionally together with the company.

I love how every day is a challenge and working with great people who help me grow professionally and as a person.
